# Adaptive LLM-based Game Radio (ALGR)
This repository provides the relevant code base of the paper Adaptive LLM-based Game Radio (ALGR).

The radio implementation and resulting paper was part of a student game project at Stuttgart Media University (HdM) called "Adverse" and took part during the summer semester 2023.

Keep in mind that the Unity scripts of this repo do not compile, since the complete game source is not provided and therefore some referenced resources are missing. This repo serves as an example for one possible implementation of the Adaptive LLM-based Game Radio template provided in the paper.
